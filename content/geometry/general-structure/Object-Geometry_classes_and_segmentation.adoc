= Object/Geometry classes and segmentation

== Object classes (for example, vehicles, pedestrians, road networks, ...), sync with other standards
* For vehicles like bicycles, motorbikes, scooters, and so on, differentiate between the vehicle and the person on it. Vehicle and pedestrian are two different objects.
* Classes to consider in this project:
** Vehicles
** Pedestrians
** Roads and road infrastructure
** Vegetation (including tree) ?
**Building ?
** Animal ?
** Custom/other/unknown

== Class-specific node/semantic/animation/material structure, coordinate systems, and pivot points
* General:
** xy center of bounding box, z on the ground in default pose (vehicle doors closed, T-pose for pedestrians, and so on)
* Vehicles
** Hierarchy and nodes see below
* Class-specific file name convention?
* Think about new or rare structures (for example, front trunk)
* Class-specific levels of detail and impostors
