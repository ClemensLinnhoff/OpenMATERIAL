= File format
The ASAM OpenMATERIAL standard supports the following file formats:

* JSON for the 3D asset file, which is used for mapping ASAM OpenMATERIAL based on node, mesh, or material names (see also [link to 3D asset in Terms and definitions])
* glTF for 3D model file
* FBX
* USD

NOTE: TODO: Check whether JSON format is correct for first bullet point.
