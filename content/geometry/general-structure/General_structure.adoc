= General structure

== Dimensions
* Unit: meters

== Coordinate systems
* Use ISO 8855:
** right-handed: x forward, y left, z up
* In line with ASAM OpenDRIVE, ASAM OpenSCENARIO, ASAM OSI
* Origins of the coordinate frames to be discussed for specific object classes later

== Naming conventions
* Prefix in the 3D model file name to show that it is according to standard, for example, "omg_" (open material geometry)
* Same file name for 3D model and asset file
** 3D model file: omg_my-model.gltf
** Asset file: omg_my-model.x... (extension see below)
* Putting more information in file name to be discussed for specific object classes

== Asset file (mapping, metadata,...)
* json format
* File extension (different from material files)
** xoma (open material asset)
** xomg (open material geometry)
* Contents
** Metadata
** Material mapping (with possibility to easily change assignment)
** Optional link to another asset file to facilitate instancing (same asset file for different 3D models)
** Semantic information (labels) for sub-meshes ?
** Description of coordinates, pivot points and so on instead of hierarchy in 3D model file ?
** Assigning data streams (for example, wheel rotation) to certain sub-meshes ?

== Requirements (quality, semantic/animation/material structure, and so on)
* Separation of materials
* ...

== Recommendations (performance measures and so on)
* Same texel density within a file
* Object class dependent recommendations for mesh resolution
* Performance recommendations ? (for example, use alpha textures for vegetation)
* ...
