==    What is a 3D asset/geometry?
A 3D asset/geometry refers to a digital object that consists of both a 3D model and its accompanying properties nad metadata. The 3D model itself is the geometric representation of the object, usually stored in formats like glTF, FBX, or USD.

However, with the use of ASAM OpenMATERIAL specifications, the 3D asset file (e.g., omg_my-model.xoma) contains essential information relevant to the display and interactive ability of the 3D model in various computer applications , for instance, metadata, material mappings, and semantic information (e.g. Coordinate, pivot point descriptions and data stream assignement for sub meshes). It links specific material properties (such as textures, reflectivity, etc.) to the geometry and allows for dynamic adjustments, like changing material assignments easily.

This setup allows the 3D asset/geometry to be more versatile and rich in detail, ensuring it can be used in complex simulations or real-time environments with detailed material and dynamic properties.

==    For which use cases are assets needed?
To accurately replicate the real-world interaction of sensors with objects, ensuring that the behavior of sensors like cameras, radars, or LIDARs is correctly modeled based on the material and geometric properties of objects in the virtual environment, assets that adhere to ASAM OpenMATERIAL standards can be needed in various use cases such as:

* Accurate Sensor Perception Simulation: 3D assets are needed to ensure that the sensors interact realistically with their environment. This includes both the visual representation (how objects look and are detected by the sensor) and the material properties (how objects reflect or absorb signals, such as light or radar waves).
* Dynamic and Real-Time Environment Simulations: 3D assets with dynamic properties, such as moving parts (e.g. wheels) or changing materials, are necessary for simulating environments where the interaction between sensors and objects is constantly changing.
* Semantic Labeling for Machine Learning applications: Assets with semantic information about sub-meshes (labels for parts of objects) allows the system to understand and differentiate between various parts of an object, like a car's wheels or windows, and aids in accurate training.
* Instancing for Efficient Simulation: In sensor simulations, same asset file for different 3D models allows instances without needing separate assets for each, saving computational resources while maintaining consistency.


==    What is the role of 3D exchange formats in OpenMATERIAL?
3D exchange formats like glTF, FBX, or USD that provide a standardized way to represent 3D models and geometries and are already widely used across industries. In the context of OpenMATERIAL, these formats serve as a baseline to allow OpenMATERIAL to integrate seamlessly into existing 3D modeling and simulation workflows.

==    How do the OpenMATERIAL specifications build on/extend existing file formats and their specifications?
Users can continue using their familiar tools and processes to handle geometry, while OpenMATERIAL extends these formats allowing for the mentioned usecases by adding material properties, semantic information, and dynamic behaviors through additional files (.xoma files).

==    What is the difference between reference 3D geometry and materials?
* Reference 3D geometry defines the shape, size, and spatial structure of an object, focusing on its physical boundaries and surfaces that sensors detect in a simulation. It is essential for representing how objects appear and occupy space. 
* Materials, on the other hand, specify how the surface of that geometry interacts with the environment. These include both rendering materials (for visual appearance) and physics-based sensor materials, which determine how objects respond to sensor signals like light, radar, or LIDAR.

==    How is this standard interacting with other ASAM standards, such as OpenSCENARIO, OpenDRIVE, OSI,...
ASAM open material and other ASAM standards aim to comprehensive and highly realistic simulations that can be created by integrating behavioral logic, infrastructure, and material properties into a unified system for development and testing of autonomous systems ("digital twins" or highly accurate virtual representations of real-world entities).
* OpenSCENARIO provides the behavioral framework, and OpenMATERIAL ensures that the objects behave realistical sensor perception within this scenario.

* OpenDRIVE defines the road infrastructure, with OpenMATERIAL adding material details for more accurate physical representaion of elements of this road and its interactions with the sensors:

* Open Simulation Interface handles sensor data exchanging with other parties in the simulation, which is influenced by the material characteristics defined by OpenMATERIAL.

==    Is the standardization of 3D models specified by OpenMATERIAL separated from the standardization of materials in OpenMATERIAL? 
NOTE: TODO: (tbd)
