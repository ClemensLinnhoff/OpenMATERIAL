General comments:

- OpenDRIVE Variable Message Boards already possess local coordinate frame  

- Proposal: Include correct  Road/Lane/Junction/... ID from OpenDRIVE as suffix in naming, e.g. Road_100, Lane_-3 etc.  

- Railroads, corresponding tracks and stations are probably something discuss in GitHub. This may be a topic for a version > 1.0?
