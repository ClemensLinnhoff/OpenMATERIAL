= Use Cases

////
Use cases in the context of ASAM standards describe the external behavior of the standardized system, that is, the interaction of the system with a user or another system.
The description of use cases is particularly useful for explaining the motivation for:

* New standards
* Development projects for a new major version of a standard
* Development projects for adding features to a minor version of a standard

Use cases are divided in three groups that view the standard from different perspectives.
A project proposal should consider all three perspectives in order to provide a comprehensive overview.

* *Business use cases* describe an economic advantage, a corporate requirement, a process, a method, or an element in a larger tool chain, which involves many people within one company or across multiple companies that have a customer-supplier relationship.

* *End user use cases* describe a requirement, process, method, or element of a tool chain that are handled by users who work with the standard.

* *Technical use cases* describe technical requirements for the operation and interoperability of technical systems, such as tools, test systems, or application software, which the standard supports.

== User stories (optional)
It might be useful for new projects to extend use cases to user stories.
User stories provide a more comprehensive picture of user needs.
Use the following template:

_As a <user role>, I want to <do>, <have>, <use> something because / in order to..._

Example: As an AV/ADAS developer, I want to search, review and reuse scenarios built by other companies, because we rely on specialized external suppliers for scenario data for our development activities.
